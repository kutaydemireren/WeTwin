This was a personal project for personal development in iOS. Written in Swift 2.

It is about entering some chat topics and talking to people. With WeTwin, we tried help people to find their 'twins'. Back-end was in charge of my friend, where I do not have access to it and closed. 

If you want to run the project,  you probably will have to convert Swift 2 into Swift 3 syntax, and update the related Pods. If some of the pods are not supported in Swift 3, you might even have to find alternate.
